## run_analysis.R

This analysis script merges the training and test sets in the UCI HAR Dataset, extracts the mean and standard deviations for the measurements of each variable, appropriately describes and labels the data, and creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each subject and activity performed.

## UCI HAR Dataset

This directory contains the original datasets upon which the analysis script acts.

## tidy_data.txt

This txt file is the tidy data set produced by the analysis script.
